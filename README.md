# PizzaHouse

Welcome to the PizzaHouse, a React-based pizza ordering application designed to simulate the experience of ordering your favorite pizzas from the comfort of your home.

The PizzaHouse project is a hands-on exercise to apply various React and modern web development concepts in a real-world application scenario.

## Key Features 🍕

- **User Information Input**: Allows entering personal details such as name, phone number, and address for pizza delivery.
- **Menu View**: Browse the pizza menu and add items to the cart with options to modify quantities or remove them.
- **Cart Management**: Manage your order in the cart page, change pizza quantities, remove items, and review the total price.
- **Order Types**: Choose from standard or priority delivery options, with priority delivery incurring an extra cost.
- **Geolocation Ordering**: Place orders using geolocation services and reverse geocoding for address determination.
- **Order Tracking**: Follow the order status with a unique ID provided after placing the order.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with efficient, declarative, and flexible components.
- **Redux**: A state management tool that helps manage the state of the application with a single, immutable state tree.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs with a mobile-first approach.
- **React Router**: A collection of navigational components for creating single-page applications with dynamic, client-side routing.

## Learning Objectives 📚

This project served as a practice ground for the following key concepts:

Conditional Rendering: Dynamically render different components based on the application state.
Redux State Management: Manage global state with Redux for a predictable state container across the app.
Responsive Design: Utilize Tailwind CSS to ensure the application is mobile-friendly and adaptable to various screen sizes.
